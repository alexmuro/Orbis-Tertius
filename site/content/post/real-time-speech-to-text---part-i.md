I'm interested in computer systems that interact well with humans which is a broad and difficult task. To narrow that down to a place to start I have decided to look at speech to text, a problem space that has seen great advancement in the last year. To start I am going to look at available open source implementations of text to speech deep learning implementations.

My longer term goals for this project are to try to train a network to get additional information that humans process out of speech such as identifying individual speakers and understanding the sentiment available in the intonation of phrases.

##Open Source Implementations

Taking a quick look around the internet there seem to be
