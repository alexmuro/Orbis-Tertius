On the morning of the second day
Julius with twinkling eyes began
on the sidewalks who steady stay
under sky hawks who dream a plan
to descend to the depths of the city
and never pretend before dwarven pity

Who among you? asks Julius
can remember the sun and the stars
with interminable warmth and foolishness
who seem so close yet are so far
while passing souls listen with disdain
oh Eupheus were your words not plain?
