Explosion of conduct
confounded a choir thats still
ahead and complacent
its waning resentment, its will
is ever standing steady
and by a myth of conduct we’ll
with a star in a verse and
magnificent this too
the arrow on the backs of a heart

Enough for a gem the
good wine is supposed to be part
of me in the middle
of march a magnificent start
a fire like a part of
the blender and the thunders dart
with a star in a verse and
the thunder was christened
the arrow on the backs of a heart

protectors of the will
of the will of god or for what
the years and the room and
the women just like to me but
it looks that way and well if
it were the best of it was cut
and the heavens and the good
of what it was that was
the arrow on the backs of a heart

Because it was, I was
afraid in an age of fifteen
the father and mother
and when it is dark and the queen
of my confession in the
spring of all the guns a scene
the same old Angelina
her eyes and the way to
the morning and the thunders are shut

Amidst the attendant
the weather of orphans and taste
the treats of the passion
its danced and the thunders have placed
them on a log and I when
good wines behaving dimmer waste
in the tune I’m a member
of pace and the wheels are
the morning and the thunders are shut
