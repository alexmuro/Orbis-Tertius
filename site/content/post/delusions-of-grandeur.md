<pre>
for you, you only wanted to
tell yourself you tried
what a strangling lie
to see and feel the guilt you hide
and now that we finally recognize
when we look back and see how
we compromised
its so tempting to decide
that the dreams you once had
held so high, they were a lie

to me, you plea, let it be
I wonder if I'll find
adventure in my time
to see the world again like clay
to mold for any reason you might say
when we look back and see our naivet√©
the choices we had to weigh
is there a difference from night to day
not in a way

what is wrong after after all
with delusions of grandeur
so long as you can call
the price you pay after
